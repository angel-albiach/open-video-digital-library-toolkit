OVDLT status - 2009-07-21
    - General fixes
        - remove space from all sidebar icons using >
        - Pagination styling
    - Graphics
        - Need source files for buttons, or can Drew make:
            - Register and Send New Password buttons similar to Login
            - Save button
            - Slightly smaller Download button for Video Details page
    - Common Page Layout elements  -- layout/application.html.haml
        - Logo - defined as background image in css -- how to get same
          look using Steven's code which defines logo as img in layout?
        - Need to verify Forget password, Register, New Password forms
          work
        - Clicking Login or Register should put the cursor focus in the
          Username field
    - Home Page - home/index.html.haml
        - [postpone] Need to have Featured videos alternate even | odd
          rows to get gray bg
        - [postpone] Collection list also needs to alternate row bg
        - Steven
            - Featured video image should be larger; can do after we
              generate larger surrogates
                - Where is size of image specified (.first class?)?
            - Redo Browse accordian with li tags like orginal code to
              enable drag and drop and eliminate validation errors
            - Save New Order button should only show when doing drag
              and drop - currently shows for Non-logged in users (also
              does on ovdlt3 so Larry probably didn't figure this
              completely out)
            - Drop doesn't work for home page items
    - Videos
        - Accordian images - placeholder image for cases where no
          storyboard (tried using .jcarousel-item .image class in
          structure.sass but height is too big)
        - In videos list, need the genre under thumbnail linked to
          search on that genre attribute
        - Steven
            - Need a route for Random Videos to be able to update
              video/random partial for correct link for "See more
              random videos" at top
            - Clicking on Browse accordian Genre descriptor type should
              refresh thumbs area with videos of that type
                - Works in ovdlt3 version -- need to update the
                  application.js to work with divs and classes in vew
                  markup?
            - Carousel code uses a "page=" attribute of carousel_page
              class within carousel_pager class. The page attribute is
              not valid but javascript refers to it so need to figure
              out how to use another way to provide hook to page of the
              carousel.
            - Accordian code needs to be fixed to remove invalid
              nesting of divs within a dl tag
    - Collections - collections/index
        - Long titles should be contained within left main col
        - Better placement of the "show all" text ?
        - Subscribe code should do something
        - Steven
            - Show total number of collections in parenthesis after
              Browse Collections title?
            - Drag and drop works but order doesn't stick. Also,
              dragging is glitchy on Firefox, not Safari
            - If logged in as Admin, Show All link in
              collections/_index not active for some reason
            - Need a way to create a new collection versus playlist?
            - Need a way to delete a collection
        - Validates
    - Collection - collections/show
        - Had to put right column code in collections/_show partial
          when it seems like it should go into collections/show, but
          couldn't get the nesting right
        - Long titles should be contained within left main col
        - Subscribe code should do something
        - Steven
            - Need to get "Add to favorites" and "Add to playlist"
              links on same line as View video details. Each comes from
              partial and can't figure out how to keep partial-included
              content on same line
            - Validates if user not logged in. the "Add to favorites"
              and "Add to playlist" partials cause validation problems
              because they use a form and I'm trying to keep all these
              links on same line within a %p tag.
    - Playlists
        - Mockups use different page layout for Collections and
          Playlists
            - Need to create new _playlists partial for Playlists?
        - Need to move page header (Browse Collections) into
          collection/playlist specific partial to keep from having
          Browse Collections heading on Playlists page. Was working
          correctly before I started messing with things.
        - Need to format Create New Playlist page with new style
        - If user is creator -- public / private checkbox
        - If user is creator -- edit / delete checkbox
    - About, News, Privacy
        - Need to add some placeholder content to defalt database so
          user has some text on each page by default.
            - A bit fancier for Contact page
    - Video Details
        - Double check code to output rights/license stuff to make sure
          cases where no rights holder, or html with images, works
        - Would look better to have some bottom padding between Details
          sections' text and the next section label, within the
          Accordian.
        - Need to revise path for loading storyboard stills:
            - /public/surrogates/<video_name>/stills/small/
        - Would be nice to make the Watch Full Size Video Link use
          popup overlay (similar to Login/Register) instead of new
          window
        - Need to figure out Embed code or remove from Tools
        - Need to make Print style sheet for printing
        - Would be nice to have the "Login to add tags" link use the
          popup login, but right now that is triggered by an #login
          (already defined in header code from application layout) and
          can't have two ids with same name on same page.
        - Steven
            - [postpone] In longer term, we probably should use ajax to
              load each view (Details, Storyboard, etc.) on demand,
              rather than at initial page load. Too slow now.
            - For valid HTML, need to check that none of the Details
              sections (e.g. Responsible Entities) is blank before
              ouputting a ul tag (empty ul causes validation error).
            - Need code to output Dates, Responsible Entities, and
              Descriptors
            - Text for Add to Favorites and Add to Playlist links not
              on same line as icon. Same problem I had with Save this
              search on results page. All my fixes use invalid HTML.
            - When a video has multiple video assets -- need strategy
              for the Watch Full Size Video link in left column. For
              now, just link to first found asset?
            - Need code to load the excerpt and fast forwards
                - /public/surrogates/<video_name>/excerpts/
                - /public/surrogates/<video_name>/fastforwards/
            - Problem with storyboard code caused by me adding new
              styling:
                - Current videos work fine with new code, but when
                  creating a new record, I get error when Finishing and
                  control goes to videos/show page. Error is:
                    - You have a nil object when you didn't expect it!
                      ...
                    - Current relevant code is: - if images =
                      video.storyboard

                    - Previous code was:     - if
                      params[:details_format] == "storyboard" and |
                               images = video.storyboard |
                    - Problem has to do with naming convention for
                      still images. The latest format is:
                        - 0002.0001_H_sms00256.256.jpg
                    - Old format is:
                        - 1200_I_375.364.jpg
                    - When I put an old video's stills in the new video
                      stills dir, no error
                - New video - Video iself doesn't show up in left
                  column; same naming problem as above? New video I
                  added was "0002.0001_H.mov"
    - Search Results
        - Steven
            - Can we change default number of items displayed based on
              view? For example, default to 70 for small thumbs.
            - In all results views, need image to be linked to Details
              page (especially the thumbs_only)
            - Save this search -- text not on same line as icon. Fixed
              this but in doing so used invalid HTML. Can't figure out
              how to keep function working without invalid HTML.
    - My
        - Home page - none of the remove links work
        - Home page - should we get rid of edit link for Saved Searches?
            - Same question on Saved searches page
        - Playlists page - need to figure out new style formatting
        - Playlists page - should be able to remove from this page
        - Saved searches page - make the main content area two columns?
        - Account page - need to verify change password works
        - Steven
            - Favorites, Downloads pages - the collections/_show
              partial causes error: "undefined local variable or method
              `bookmarks' for #<ActionView::Base:0x48794d0>"
            - Saved searches  page - would validate except have problem
              with javascript adding thumbs class which causes details
              div to be hidden, so have wrong indentation currently.
              HTML will validate if I figure out how to not trigger the
              adding of thumbs class.
    - Cataloging
        - What was in tabs now in sidebar, and now using JQuery
          Accordian for page sections (i.e., Accordian bars == fieldset
          labels)
        - Digital Files - Need some work on pagination - my style
          changes resulted in the Prev and Next buttons being up top in
          weird place
        - Digital Files - Would look better to right-align type and
          size in current assets and browse tables
        - Digital Files - Search needs background for drop-down menu
          when entering a value
        - Dates - Could use better formatting/placement, especially if
          no values currently set
        - Responsible Entities - Needs styling but wait until Dates
          works completely to use similar code
        - Steven
            - General Information - Duration (under Description)
              doesn't hold edited value.
            - Digital Files - When adding a new asset through the
              Search box, the type and size don't show up in the
              current assets table (they do if you add through the
              Browse table)
            - Descriptors - Values don't hold when edited
        - Validates
